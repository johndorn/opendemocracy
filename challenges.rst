Challenges
--------

- How do we prevent a person from voting online and in person? - *How is this done for absentee and provisional ballots currently?*
- Provisional and absentee ballots include the name with the vote. Anonymity is waived. 
These are counted after the initial vote, if necessary, and investigated individually.
- The only option may be to only allow online voting a time before the general election voting starts.
