Authentication:
	client certificates
	passwords using advanced, but slow, hashing
	mixture of the two...

Necessities:
	- One auth token must be certified per voter by an election official, ensures 1 person, 1 vote
	- User must have additional auth token challenge - password, private key, etc
	- Must restrict user to voting only once per election on any ballot issue or candidate
	- Must anonymize actual votes
	- Need to prevent this person from voting again in person
		- How is this done with respect to absentee/provisional ballots currently?
